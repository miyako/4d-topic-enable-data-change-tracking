# Enable Data Change Tracking
presentation material for [4D Method User Group Meeting #76](https://4dmethod.com/2025/01/09/enable-data-change-tracking-keisuke-miyako/)

## SQL vs Mirroring vs DCT

there are several mechanisms built into 4D that allows the replication of records between databases.

* **Replication via SQL** is based on a proprietary SQL command that allows data to be replicated or synchronised between 4D databases. the feature can be activate per table. when activated, 3 virtual fields are added to the table which are only accessible via SQL. their values are stored outside the main database, in the files *.4DSyncHeader* and *.4DSyncData*. the delta between local and remote databases are managed by comparing the `__ROW_STAMP` virtual field for each table.
	* the remote database must be **4D Server**
	* the local database can be 4D Desktop or 4D Server 
	* object fields are not supported    
* **4DSYNC** is a URL reserved by the 4D Web Server that triggers a mechanism similar to SQL replication over HTTP. the behaviour on the server side is completely automatic. the data is sent to the server in XML format.
	* this feature is **deprecated**
	* the remote database must be **4D Web Server**
	* the local database can be any HTTP agent
	* object fields are not supported
	* this feature was especially designed for the iSort for iOS app
* **Mirroring** is an extension of the standard backup mechanism based on journal files that allows data to be replicated between 4D databases. unlike SQL replication or synchronisation, the complete change history is reproduced, not just the final record data. only 4D Server can create or integrate journal segment files. the delta between local and remote databases are managed by comparing the journal operation number of each database.
	* both databases must be **4D Server**
	* one must developer their own system for sending and receiving journal segment files
* Data Change Tracking is a sysmtem similar to SQL repliation or 4DSYNC but with the following advantages:
	* ORDA, not SQL
 	* native objects, not XML 
	* supports object fields
	* no external files such as *.4DSyncHeader* or *.4DSyncData*
  	* better access control

# Phase 3

1. intentionally break *roles.json*
2. restart interpreted
3. check *Roles_Errors.json*
4. restore *roles.json*
5. restart interpreted; *Roles_Errors.json* goes away
6. expose as REST server
7. create *On Server Startup*

```4d
ASSERT(Not(Folder(fk logs folder).file("Roles_Errors.json").exists))

var $server : 4D.WebServer
$server:=WEB Server

If (Not($server.isRunning))
	$status:=$server.start({HTTPPort: 80; HTTPEnabled: True})
	ASSERT($status.success)
End if 
```

# Phase 4

1. open with 20 R6+ server
2. connect with local client
3. create REST client with 2nd instance of 4D 20
4. connect to local datastore via REST

```4d
var $options : Object
$options:={hostname: "127.0.0.1:80"}

var $ds : 4D.DataStoreImplementation
$ds:=Open datastore($options; "local")
```

> notice no user name or password is required to connect. this is [force login mode](https://blog.4d.com/force-login-becomes-default-for-all-rest-auth/) which replaces *On REST Authentication*.

```4d
var $clients : 4D.EntitySelection
$clients:=$ds.Clients.all()
```

> an error is raised bacause a call to `ds.authentify()` is mandatory (force login mode).

5. create `ds.authentify` on the server.

```4d
Class extends DataStoreImplementation

exposed Function authentify($params : Object) : Object
	
	var $status : Object
	$status:={success: False}
	
	If ($params.secret="demo-demo-2025-0123")
		$status.success:=Session.setPrivileges(["DCT"])
	End if 
	
	return $status
```

> remember to add the `exposed` keyword. also the REST server must be restarted for the change to take effect.

6. add new `privilege` to *roles.json*

```json
"privileges": [
	{
		"privilege": "none"
	},
        {
		"privilege": "DCT"
        }
]
```

> "none" is a special [locking privilege](https://developer.4d.com/docs/ORDA/privileges#default-file) that has no permissions.

7. add `ds.authentify()` call to the REST client.

```4d
var $status : Object
//%W-550.2
$status:=$ds.authentify({secret: "demo-demo-2025-0123"})
//%W+550.2
```

> the `%W` compiler directive is used to [disable specific warnings locally](https://developer.4d.com/docs/Project/compiler#disabling-and-enabling-warnings-locally). this is because `.authentify()` is not a native member function of 4D.DataStoreImplementation. see also the blog post [Customize Global Warnings Generation](https://blog.4d.com/customize-global-warnings-generation/) 

> the REST client must also be restarted because the remote datastore proxy object `ds("local")` would be cached from the previous connection.

8. attempt to access data.

```4d
var $clients : 4D.EntitySelection
$clients:=$ds.Clients.all()
```

> an error is raised because access is not explicitly given in *roles.json*.

9. edit *roles.json*

```json
"allowed": [
	{
		"applyTo":"ds",
		"type": "datastore",
		"read": ["none"],
		"create": ["none"],
		"update": ["none"],
		"drop": ["none"],
		"describe": ["none"],
		"execute": ["none"],
		"promote": ["none"]
	},
	{
		"applyTo":"Clients",
		"type": "dataClass",
		"read": ["DCT"],
		"create": ["DCT"],
		"update": ["DCT"],
		"drop": ["DCT"],
		"describe": ["none"],
		"execute": ["none"],
		"promote": ["none"]
	},
	{
		"applyTo":"Invoices",
		"type": "dataClass",
		"read": ["DCT"],
		"create": ["DCT"],
		"update": ["DCT"],
		"drop": ["DCT"],
		"describe": ["none"],
		"execute": ["none"],
		"promote": ["none"]
	},
	{
		"applyTo":"Products",
		"type": "dataClass",
		"read": ["DCT"],
		"create": ["DCT"],
		"update": ["DCT"],
		"drop": ["DCT"],
		"describe": ["none"],
		"execute": ["none"],
		"promote": ["none"]
	},
	{
		"applyTo":"Invoice_Lines",
		"type": "dataClass",
		"read": ["DCT"],
		"create": ["DCT"],
		"update": ["DCT"],
		"drop": ["DCT"],
		"describe": ["none"],
		"execute": ["none"],
		"promote": ["none"]
	},
	{
		"applyTo":"__DeletedRecords",
		"type": "dataClass",
		"read": ["DCT"],
		"create": ["DCT"],
		"update": ["DCT"],
		"drop": ["DCT"],
		"describe": ["none"],
		"execute": ["none"],
		"promote": ["none"]
	}
]
```

10. test access to all tables

```4d
var $clients : 4D.EntitySelection
$clients:=$ds.Clients.all()

var $invoices : 4D.EntitySelection
$invoices:=$ds.Invoices.all()

var $products : 4D.EntitySelection
$products:=$ds.Products.all()

var $invoice_lines : 4D.EntitySelection
$invoice_lines:=$ds.Invoice_Lines.all()

var $__deletedrecords : 4D.EntitySelection
$__deletedrecords:=$ds.__DeletedRecords.all()
```

> this time it is not necessary to restart the REST client because the change is applied on the server side. only the REST server needs to be restarted.

## permissions, privileges, roles

* **permission** is the authority to perform specific actions on specific resources. basic CRUD actions (create, read, update, drop) each require specific permissions. there are 2 types of permissions (execute, promote) for code execution. there used to be a 7th type of permission (describe) for reading only the catalog information but this was deprecated in 20 R7.

* both a **privilege** and a **role** represents the possession of 0 or more permissions. the difference is that a privilege is the technical ability to exercise a a set of permissions whereas a role describes the typical user profile who needs the privileges to exercise a a set of permissions. 

* it is not mandatory to define roles; you can work only with privileges. a privilege can includes a group of other privileges. the [`Session.setPrivileges()`](https://developer.4d.com/docs/API/SessionClass#setprivileges) function accepts:

1. a single privilege name
2. a collection of privilege names
3. a single role
4. a collection of roles
5. any combination of the above

you may defines roles as user-friendly abstractions instead of referring to privileges directly. whether you use roles or not, a session is internally assigned a collection of privileges, not roles. 

# Phase 5

1. download [DCT](https://github.com/miyako/DCT) project and install as component
2. add a wrapper for `ds.getGlobalStamp()`

```4d
exposed Function getRemoteGlobalStamp() : Real
	
	return ds.getGlobalStamp()
```

3. edit *roles.json*

```json
{
	"applyTo":"ds.getRemoteGlobalStamp",
	"type": "method",
	"read": ["none"],
	"create": ["none"],
	"update": ["none"],
	"drop": ["none"],
	"describe": ["none"],
	"execute": ["DCT"],
	"promote": ["none"]
}
``` 

4. trace the `cs.DCT.DCT` class

```4d
var $DCT : cs.DCT.DCT

$DCT:=cs.DCT.DCT.new()

If ($DCT.connect({hostname: "localhost"; idleTimeout: 100}))
	
	var $ds : 4D.DataStoreImplementation
	$ds:=$DCT.ds
	
	var $status : Object
	//%W-550.2
	$status:=$ds.authentify({secret: "demo-demo-2025-0123"})
	//%W+550.2
	
	If ($status.success)
		
		$DCT.sync()
		
	End if 
	
End if
```

5. modify records locally
6. trace the `cs.DCT.DCT` class
7. modify records remotely
8. trace the `cs.DCT.DCT` class

## Extra

### which licenses would I need to use DCT?

the remote (server) database needs to be published as a REST server. this means you need licenses to publish the application as a REST server. [connections via REST Server are handled as session-based connections with a minimum usage time of 60 minutes](https://downloads.4d.com/Documents/Website/Legal/4D_Product_Specific_Terms/4D_Product_Specific_Terms_English.pdf).
* 4D Developer Professional (which comes with [one local access and one remote access](https://downloads.4d.com/Documents/Website/Legal/4D_Product_Specific_Terms/4D_Product_Specific_Terms_English.pdf) to test the REST server)
* 4D Team Developer Professional (likewise)
* 4D Server ([REST connection requires a client expansion license](https://downloads.4d.com/Documents/Website/Legal/4D_Product_Specific_Terms/4D_Product_Specific_Terms_English.pdf))

**Note**: even though REST technically uses HTTP, the Web Server or Web Services license does NOT give access to the REST server. 

the client (local) database needs to connent to the REST server with [Open datastore](https://developer.4d.com/docs/commands/open-datastore). all product licenses has access to this command. 
* 4D Desktop (formally 4D SQL Desktop)
* 4D Desktop Business Edition (formally 4D OEM Desktop)
* 4D Developer Professional 
* 4D Team Developer Professional
* 4D Server 
* 4D Developer Standard ([communicating with other servers is permitted for reading data as well as writing data within the limit of twice every twenty-four hours](https://downloads.4d.com/Documents/Website/Legal/4D_Product_Specific_Terms/4D_Product_Specific_Terms_English.pdf))
* 4D Unlimited Desktop (likewise)

**Note**: the [openDatastore](https://developer.qodly.com/docs/language/commands/openDatastore) command is also available in Qodly. see the blog post [When Qodly.com Meets 4D Server, What Are They Talking About?](https://blog.4d.com/when-qodly-com-meets-4d-server-what-are-they-talking-about/)

### wouldn't data be sent in clear text if I use HTTP over port 80?

yes. in production you should disable HTTP and use HTTPS. see [Enabling TLS with the HTTP server](https://developer.4d.com/docs/Admin/tls#enabling-tls-with-the-http-server)

### are triggers fired during DCT replication?

yes. the component uses the standard ORDA functions [`entity.drop()`](https://developer.4d.com/docs/API/EntityClass#drop) and [`entity.save()`](https://developer.4d.com/docs/API/EntityClass#save) to perform CRUD operations. [triggers](https://doc.4d.com/4Dv20/4D/20.5/Triggers.300-7389331.en.html) for each table. it is also up to you to decide whether to implement [transactions and/or pessimisitic locking](https://developer.4d.com/docs/ORDA/datastores#locking-and-transactions).  see also

* [ALTER TABLE](https://doc.4d.com/4Dv20/4D/20/ALTER-TABLE.300-6342143.en.html)
* [ALTER DATABASE](https://doc.4d.com/4Dv20/4D/20/ALTER-DATABASE.300-6342132.en.html)

### what happens if CRUD operation fails?

the component save the `status` object returned from `entity.drop()` or `entity.save()` in a log file. look for `writeLineâ€Ž` in [`DCT.4dm`](https://github.com/miyako/DCT/blob/main/DCT/Project/Sources/Classes/DCT.4dm).

### what happens when a save operation fails because of collision?

the component touches the entity when `entity.save()` fails, to effectively "bump" the table's global stamp. for the local database, this is done by assigning the `__GlobalStamp` field back to itself without change. for remote database, this is done by assigning the primary key back to itself without change. see `_touchLocalEntity()` and `_touchRemoteEntity()` in [`DCT.4dm`](https://github.com/miyako/DCT/blob/main/DCT/Project/Sources/Classes/DCT.4dm). touching the entity without changing its value should result in a successful `entity.save()` if the reason for failure is logical, such as collision. a successful `entity.save()` would automatically increment the global stamp. this means the entity which couldn't be updated would be excluded from the next replication.

### wouldn't the act of replication itself create a delta between the two databases?

the component increments the stamp stored for the next operation by `1` after a successful `entity.save()`. this means the entity which couldn't be updated would be excluded from the next replication. look for `__GlobalStamp+1` in [`DCT.4dm`](https://github.com/miyako/DCT/blob/main/DCT/Project/Sources/Classes/DCT.4dm).

### how can I optimise the network traffic?

DCT is based on native ORDA features, meaning all the tools available in data model classes are applicable, including the following

* the `30` seconds client cache introduced in 4D 18 R3; see [`entitySelection.refresh()`](https://developer.4d.com/docs/API/EntitySelectionClass#refresh)
* the `30000` BLOB cache introduced in 4D 19 R5; see [`ds.getRemoteCache()`](https://developer.4d.com/docs/API/DataClassClass#getremotecache), [`ds.setRemoteCacheSettings()`](https://developer.4d.com/docs/API/DataClassClass#setremotecachesettings)
* the remote context, also introduced in 4D 19 R5; see [`ds.getRemoteContextInfo()`](https://developer.4d.com/docs/API/DataStoreClass.html#getremotecontextinfo), [`ds.getAllRemoteContexts()`](https://developer.4d.com/docs/API/DataStoreClass.html#getallremotecontexts)

also any tables and fields not made available via REST are never sent over the network.

### is it normal that I see `2` users on my server admin window?

yes. an [`Open datastore`](https://developer.4d.com/docs/commands/open-datastore) call normally creates `2` REST processes on the server, which appear on the "Users" page of the server admin window. starting with 20 R5 (force login mode) these connection do not consume 4D Client Expansion licenses. see blog article "[Improved 4D Client Licenses Usage with Qodly Studio for 4D](https://blog.4d.com/improved-4d-client-licenses-usage-with-qodly-studio-for-4d/)". licenses are allocated after a successful [`ds.authentify()`](https://developer.4d.com/docs/REST/authUsers#function-authentify). you can check the number of used licenses in the "Monitor" page of the server admin window. you can also type

```4d
License info.products.query("name == :1"; "4D Client")[0].usedCount
```

in the runtime explorer.

in the context of REST access to the server, the number of used licenses 

```4d
Process activity.sessions.query("type == :1"; "rest").extract("systemUserName"; "name"; "IPAddress"; "address"; "ID"; "session")
```

do not necessarily correspond to the number of user sessions.
